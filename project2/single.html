            <img class="w-100" src="https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/karnali-sapat.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Chief Minister of Karnali Province, Yam Lal Kandel, has given completeness to the government. 22 days after being appointed as the Chief Minister, Kandel completed the government by appointing six ministers on Tuesday.
</p>
                Kandel, who was appointed as the Chief Minister on April 9, appointed three ministers each from the Maoist and UML on Tuesday after a long-term tussle between the two major parties of the ruling coalition, the UML and the Maoist Centre.
                
                On behalf of the Maoists, Mahendra KC has been appointed as Minister of Economic Affairs and Planning; Bir Bahadur Shahi as Minister of Social Development; Durga Bahadur Rawat as Minister of Industry, Tourism Forestry and Environment and Ransingh Pariyar as Minister of Water Resources and Energy Development.
                
                Likewise, Gamata BK has been appointed as the Minister of State for Physical Infrastructure and Urban Development; Sher Bahadur Budha as the Minister of Physical Infrastructure and Binod Kumar Shah as the Minister of Lands, Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives from UML. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law has been held by Chief Minister Kandel himself.
                On April 24, Chief Minister Kandel appointed Ransingh Periyar, a member of parliament from the ruling party Maoist Center, as a non-departmental minister.
                
                Among the newly appointed ministers, Mahendra KC, Bir Bahadur Shahi, Durga Rawat and Sher Bahadur Budha have already taken the oath.
                
                UML’s Binod Shah, who was appointed as Minister of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives, did not attend the oath ceremony.</p>
